My life
meant nothing to me
then a guy like you came along

Everything
is moving so fast,
I gotta get my feet on the ground

Unhappy days are over 'cause I can
always be with you

Lying in your arms day by day,
makes me feel Ohh... so brand new

Can't stop fallin' in love
Tell me you will be true (forever baby)
I just can't stop dreaming of you
everyday (every way)

Say you love me baby
Say you will always be mine
You'll never break my heart

I just can't stop fallin' in love
Baby you became
Makin' love with you
is all I wanna do, (wanna do)

Can't stop fallin' in love
Give your heart and soul
Stay with me this time
and we'll make history, (you and me)
